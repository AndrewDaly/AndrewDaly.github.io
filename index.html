        <p>StaticHands is a project to improve user-computation interaction.</p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            In my opinion, most computer users are interacting with their physical machines in a suboptimal manner.
            People can type on their keyboards far faster than they can use a mouse to point and click.
            However, the majority of software relies primarily on slower mouse-based navigation.
            When hotkeys exist, they are often essentially an after thought or are inconsistent.
            But unavoidably, they rely on moving your hand off the homerow keys of the keyboard to press 'ctrl'.
            Pressing obscure key chord centered on 'ctrl' or 'alt' is slow and unwieldy and inefficient.
            All that hinders the use of such hotkeys, which are meant to save time in the first place.
            I believe that there is a better way for people to interact with their machines.
            Which is why I started this project, in order to improve my own efficiency and practice some coding skills.
            Essentially, this project revamps the 'j' key to 'ctrl', and adds a ui based keyboard navigation mode.
            Typing 'ja' is equal to 'ctrl' + 'a', 'jf' types the 'j' key, and typing 'j' alone does nothing.
            Additionally, 'jq' creates an overlay that flags elements of the current active window with typeable buttons.
            The point is this can improve the actions per minute of most computer users.
            Keyboard navigation is not only about efficiency, but also accessibility.
            I explored AutoHotKey, however due to security concerns I elected to build my own project from open source options.
            This also allows for complex hotkeys to made simpler too, for instance, 'alt' + 'tab', can be simply 'jg'.
            I centered this script around 'j' because 'j' is on the homerow of the default qwerty keyboard, but is one
            of the least frequently used letters in English.
